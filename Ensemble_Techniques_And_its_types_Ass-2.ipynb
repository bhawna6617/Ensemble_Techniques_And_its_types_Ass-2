    "# Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is a technique used to reduce overfitting in decision trees and other machine learning models. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bootstrapping: Bagging involves creating multiple bootstrap samples from the original dataset. Bootstrap sampling involves randomly selecting observations with replacement from the original dataset to create multiple new datasets of the same size as the original.\n",
    "# Training Multiple Models: Once the bootstrap samples are created, a decision tree (or any other base learner) is trained on each bootstrap sample. Since each sample is slightly different due to the random selection with replacement, each tree will be slightly different.\n",
    "# Aggregation: After training multiple decision trees, bagging aggregates their predictions. For regression problems, this usually means averaging the predictions from each tree. For classification problems, it often involves taking a majority vote.\n",
    "# Bagging reduces overfitting primarily due to the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reduced Variance: By averaging or aggregating predictions from multiple models trained on slightly different datasets, bagging helps to reduce the variance of the model. This is because individual decision trees are prone to high variance, meaning they can overfit to the noise in the training data. By averaging multiple trees, the noise tends to cancel out, resulting in a more stable prediction.\n",
    "# Reduced Sensitivity to Outliers: Since each tree in the ensemble is trained on a different subset of data, they are less likely to be influenced by outliers or noisy data points present in the original dataset.\n",
    "# Smoothing Decision Boundaries: By combining multiple decision boundaries (from different trees), bagging tends to smooth out the overall decision boundary. This can help to generalize better to unseen data."
